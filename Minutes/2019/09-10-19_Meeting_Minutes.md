## Agenda 1: Introduction and Welcome.
Dr. Caleb Kibet opened the meeting at 9:00 a.m. Introductions were skipped as there were no new members.

## Agenda 2: Presentations.
### Presentation 1: Kennedy Mwangi.
Title: Gene Coexpression Network of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> developmental stages in tsetse fly vector <i>Glossina morsitans morsitans.</i>

### Presentation 2: Careen Naitore. 
Title: Developmentally Dynamic miRNA transcriptome in tsetse fly <i>Glossina pallidipes</i> vector of African Trypanosomiasis.

### General points.
Some general points Dr. Kibet pointed out were:
1. The need to learn how to do lightning talks by all students which will be implemented in the group. 
2. Need to practice making presentations to better the skill.
3. Time management during presentations.

## Agenda 3: Update Baobab-LIMS, RedCap and Genomic Data Storage.
### Presentation by Cynthia and Geoffrey.
Their presentation clearly outlined the purpose for the work being done, stating the problem being addressed, their main objectives broken down into general and specific objectives and a plan on how to achieve each objective. Their workflow described how the system works so far and was very insightful.

The group had multiple questions on the work. These include:
1. what happens in case of network failure during data collection using the RedCap forms to the server.
2. what are their plans in terms of backup for the data.
3. with a central repository in place, data theft is a high risk. what is the plan in place in this case. 
4. what are the data policies in place for the data collected and what would happen in case of data loss.

Andrew Espira and his team responded to these questions. He mentioned the plans in place to set up the necessary policies to enable good data management. He also acknowledged that there has been data loss in the field during collection but work is being done to reduce these incidences. A meeting is being held on 23rd October 2019 to discuss more on the data management plan.

## Agenda 4: Caleb's Mozilla Fellowship.
Dr. Kibet was recently awarded the Mozilla Fellowhip. He announced that he is beginning this work and would involve the team in the process.

## Agenda 5: Year-long Bioinformatics training activities.
Daniel Ouso higlighted the intention to organise a Data capentries workshop - Genomics Track. A tenetative date is late November. The Carpentries is an organization that teaches basic computational and coding skills to researchers. He further mentioned the plans to come up with a yearly calendar of expected training within a year.

The meeting ended at 10:30 a.m.
